# Online Euchre App with CRA, TypeScript, Firebase and probably Pixijs

## todo:

- Display currently logged in user above logout button in profile card
- Make list of lobbies and set up lobby system including button to create one
- Maybe try and do the chat before the game component just for fun.
- Ensure cards are proper length of the page once contents fill inside of them (aka learn more css :( )
- Create firestore security rules

- ### **decide on how to build game component (regular html stuff or webgl library)**
