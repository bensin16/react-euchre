# Online Euchre App with CRA, TypeScript, Firebase

## todo:

- Add actual login form/show username when logged in on the right card.
- Maybe try and do the chat before the game component just for fun.
- Ensure cards are proper length of the page once contents fill inside of them (aka learn more css :( ))

**decide on how to build game component (regular html stuff or webgl library)**
